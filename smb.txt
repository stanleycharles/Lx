------------------- Install samba packages -------------------
redhat / centos / rocky / fedora

# Become root user
# yum install samba samba-client samba-common

• Enable samba to be allowed through firewall (Only if you have firewall running)
# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-service=samba
# firewall-cmd –reload

• To stop and disable firewall or iptables
# systemctl stop firewalld
# systemctl stop iptables
# systemctl disable firewalld
# systemctl disable iptables

• Create Samba share directory and assign permissions
# mkdir -p /samba/morepretzels
# chmod a+rwx /samba/morepretzels
# chown -R nobody:nobody /samba

• Also, you need to change the SELinux security context for the samba shared
directory as follows: (Only if you have SELinux enabled)
# chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/morepretzels

• If you want to disable SELinux, follow these instructions
# sestatus To check the SELinux status)
# vi /etc/selinux/config

Change
SELINUX=enforcing
To
SELINUX=disabled
# reboot

• Modify /etc/samba/smb.conf file to add new shared filesystem (Make sure to
create a copy of smb.conf file)
Delete everything from smb.conf file and add the following parameters

[global]
    workgroup = WORKGROUP
    netbios name = centos
    security = user
    map to guest = bad user
    dns proxy = no
[Anonymous]
    path = /samba/morepretzels
    browsable = yes
    writable = yes
    guest ok = yes
    guest only = yes
    read only = no

• Verify the setting
# testparm

• Once the packages are installed, enable and start Samba services
# systemctl enable smb
# systemctl enable nmb
# systemctl start smb
# systemctl start nmb

• Mount on Windows client
o Go to start
o Go to search bar
o Type \\192.168.1.95 

(This is my server IP, you can check your Linux
CentOS IP by running the command ifconfig)

• Mount on Linux client
Become root
# yum -y install cifs-utils samba-client

Create a mount point directory
# mkdir /mnt/sambashare

Mount the samba share
# mount -t cifs //192.168.1.95/Anonymous /mnt/sambashare/
# Entry without password
Secure Samba Server

• Create a group smbgrp & user larry to access the samba server with proper
authentication

# useradd larry
# groupadd smbgrp
# usermod -a -G smbgrp larry
# smbpasswd -a larry
New SMB password: YOUR SAMBA PASS
Retype new SMB password: REPEAT YOUR SAMBA PASS
Added user larry

• Create a new share, set the permission on the share:

# mkdir /samba/securepretzels
# chown -R larry:smbgrp /samba/securepretzels
# chmod -R 0770 /samba/securepretzels
# chcon -t samba_share_t /samba/securepretzels

• Edit the configuration file /etc/samba/smb.conf (Create a backup copy first)
# vi /etc/samba/smb.conf
Add the following lines

[Secure]
    path = /samba/securepretzels
    valid users = @smbgrp
    guest ok = no
    writable = yes
    browsable = yes

• Restart the services
# systemctl restart smb
# systemctl restart nmb
